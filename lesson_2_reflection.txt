Want happens when you initialize a repository?  Why do you need to do it?
  a .git directory is created, and commits will be tracked from now on
  otherwise, no git functions will be active

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? what value do you think it offers?
	staging area offers an area for all the files that are needed in one commit, while all the current files are in working 
  directory, the repository only have all the committed files.
	the staging area offers users the flexibility to select files that need to be committed since not all files in the working directory need to be committed into the repository
